        \item {The goal of this project was to create a bot that would help moderate multiple discord servers, to make the admins' jobs easier. I created this bot with the help of a library called Discord4j, a library that was very event driven which helped make development much smoother. Integration with smaller side projects is currently in progress, to help make the bot more unique. This bot is slowly going to be ported over to use a react.js library, for both better efficiency and for educational purposes.}

        \item {This project implements the calculation of statistical values over large data sets, using separate compute devices(GPU/CPU) to process the data points in parallel. Sequential and parallel algorithms were used to compare speed up between the two, with heavy optimisation put into developing the parallel solution. The development of this project was done in a group of 3, with a heavy emphasis on coding practices such as continuous integration and code reviews. }
